Find cheap trips for the sunniest European destinations

Week-end getaways are very relaxing but they're always hard to plan. Often you don't even really know where you want to go, you just want somewhere sunny. So you're looking at weather forecasts for every city you can think of and looking up flights. Next thing you know you've got 40 open tabs in your browser and you decide that you should probably do it tomorrow. The next day, you open your computer and close the 40 tabs.

The goal of this project is to make the quest for a sunny getaway easy by combining weather forecasting and flight search. 

Weather forecasts are obtained via the Weather Underground API. You can get your (free) API key [here](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api). Flight details are obtained via the Google QPX Express API. Get your key [here](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/) (50 free queries a day).

How to use it:
- Store your API keys in API-keys.txt
- Set up your origin and destinations (default values are respectively Paris and some European cities)
- Set up your dates (default ones are from tomorrow and back 2 days later)
- Pack a suitcase

Update: QPX Express API service will end on April 10, 2018
